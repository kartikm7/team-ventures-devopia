    "question": "What are chemical equations in 250 words",
    "ai_generated_answer": "Chemical equations are symbolic representations of chemical reactions. They use chemical formulas to represent the reactants and products of a reaction, as well as the stoichiometric coefficients that balance the equation. The coefficients ensure that the number of atoms of each element on the reactants' side of the equation equals the number of atoms of that element on the products' side. This is in accordance with the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.\n\nChemical equations provide a concise and informative way to represent chemical reactions. They allow us to see the reactants, products, and their relative proportions in a single line. They also provide information about the type of reaction, such as whether it is a combination, decomposition, single displacement, double displacement, or combustion reaction.\n\nChemical equations are essential for understanding and predicting the outcome of chemical reactions. They are used in stoichiometry to calculate the quantities of reactants and products involved in a reaction. They are also used in thermodynamics to calculate the energy changes associated with reactions.",

They use chemical formulas to show the reactants and products of a reaction, as well as the stoichiometric coefficients that balance the equation. Chemical equations must be balanced in order to satisfy the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.",
