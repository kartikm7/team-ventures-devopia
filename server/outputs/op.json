    "question": "What are chemical equations in 500 words",
    "ai_generated_answer": "Chemical equations are symbolic representations of chemical reactions. They show the chemical formulas of the reactants and products of a reaction, as well as the stoichiometric coefficients that balance the equation. The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation represent the number of moles of each reactant and product involved in the reaction. Chemical equations are used to represent a variety of chemical reactions, including combustion, synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, double displacement, and acid-base reactions.\n\nChemical equations are important because they provide a concise and informative way to represent chemical reactions. They can be used to predict the products of a reaction, calculate the amount of reactants and products involved, and determine the energy changes that occur during a reaction. Chemical equations are also used in a variety of applications, such as chemical engineering, environmental science, and medicine.\n\nHere are some of the key features of chemical equations:\n\n* They use chemical formulas to represent the reactants and products of a reaction.\n* The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation represent the number of moles of each reactant and product involved in the reaction.\n* Chemical equations can be used to predict the products of a reaction.\n* Chemical equations can be used to calculate the amount of reactants and products involved in a reaction.\n* Chemical equations can be used to determine the energy changes that occur during a reaction.\n* Chemical equations are used in a variety of applications, such as chemical engineering, environmental science, and medicine.",
    "student_answer": " Chemical equations are symbolic representations of chemical reactions.

Chemical equations must be balanced in order to satisfy the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.",
